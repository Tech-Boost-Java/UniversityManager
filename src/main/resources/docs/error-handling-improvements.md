# Error Handling Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to error handling in the University Manager application. These changes enhance the robustness, user experience, and maintainability of the application by providing better error messages, more specific exception handling, and improved logging.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced GlobalExceptionHandler

The `GlobalExceptionHandler` class has been improved with:

- **Logging**: Added SLF4J logging for all exceptions, which helps with debugging and monitoring.
- **Detailed Validation Errors**: Enhanced the `BindException` handler to extract field-specific error messages.
- **Database Exception Handling**: Added specific handlers for database-related exceptions:
  - `DataIntegrityViolationException` (409 Conflict) for constraint violations
  - `DataAccessException` (500 Internal Server Error) for database access issues
- **Improved Error Messages**: Made error messages more user-friendly and informative.

### 2. Comprehensive Test Coverage

Added comprehensive test coverage for error scenarios in controller tests:

- **Validation Errors**: Tests that validation errors are properly handled by returning to the form view with error messages.
- **Service Layer Exceptions**: Tests that exceptions thrown by the service layer are properly handled.
- **Database Integrity Violations**: Tests that database constraint violations are properly handled.

## Benefits

### For Users
- More informative error messages that explain what went wrong
- Consistent error handling across the application
- Appropriate HTTP status codes for different types of errors

### For Developers
- Better logging for debugging and monitoring

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to error handling could include:

1. Custom exception classes for specific business logic errors
2. More granular exception handling for specific use cases
3. Client-side validation to complement server-side validation
4. Internationalization of error messages
5. Enhanced error tracking and monitoring
